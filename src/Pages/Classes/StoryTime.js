      As educators and as a mom, we highly believe in the importance and benefits of reading to our tots. Weâ€™ve also seen the fruition of this consistent activity to the children in our care- it expands their vocabulary and speech, develops their imagination, creativity, and other cognitive skills. Our personal favorite is children learning to understand the world around them and growing an empathy for it. We created this class so that we can encourage our local community, both parents/caregivers and children, to have an interest in reading and immerse in its benefits.
